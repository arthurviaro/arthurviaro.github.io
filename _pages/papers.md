This paper examines the medium- and long-term effects of Brazil's tariff reform in the 1990s on schooling and child labor. We exploit differences across industries in the adult and child employment composition in an empirical strategy that allows us to identify distinct effects of local economic shocks on household decisions. Relative to the national trend, we document that regions specialized in adult-specific industries experienced lower growth in schooling and higher increases in child labor, especially in paid works. Regions specialized in child-specific industries observed opposite effects. We provide evidence that these results translated into persistent effects on human capital formation and a structural transformation in employment composition.

<div id="immigration" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2" ><small>
This paper documents the effects of the mass migration episode of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century on social capital and political attitudes in Brazil. We exploit novel data containing the vote shares at the municipality level for the 1960 Presidential elections, the last under the 1946 Constitution, to investigate the medium-run effects of immigration. We find an increase in the vote share for candidates associated with left-wing parties. In the long run, we provide evidence that municipalities with a higher fraction of European immigrants elected legislators more inclined to the left and document persistent impacts on social capital. More specifically, individuals living in high exposed municipalities to immigration are more likely to support democracy, trust neighbors and institutions, and be satisfied with state performance today.

**3. Sugarcane Expansion and Development: Evidence from São Paulo** (with Yuri Luz and Marcos Nakaguma)<br/>
<small>[ <a href="#/" onclick="visib('sugarcane')">Abstract</a> | Draft (coming soon) ]</small>

<div id="sugarcane" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2" ><small>
This paper studies the impacts of sugarcane expansion on socioeconomic indicators in the Brazilian state of São Paulo, where the harvested area doubled in ten years. Using data from São Paulo municipalities and exploiting soil- and climate-induced variation in agricultural production patterns, we find that localities where sugarcane expanded experienced restructuring of the local agriculture sector from pasture lands to temporary crops. We also document a structural transformation in economic activity towards manufacturing and a faster increase in income per capita.
