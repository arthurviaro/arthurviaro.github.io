This paper studies the medium and long-run effects of Brazil’s 1990s trade liberalization reform on child labor, schooling, and human capital accumulation. Our analysis leverages extensive census and administrative data spanning nearly three decades to examine the effects of two distinct components of the shock that differentially affected the labor market opportunities for adults and children. We find that regions more exposed to child-specific tariff reductions experienced larger declines in child labor, accompanied by increases in schooling, with opposite results obtained for adult-specific tariff reductions. The effects of the shocks are persistent and always larger in the long run. Specifically, we show that tariff reductions impacted the educational attainment of the cohorts more exposed to trade liberalization during their formative years. Our results highlight the potential role of human capital investments in amplifying the impacts of economic shocks.

<div id="immigration" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2" ><small>
This paper examines the impact of historical immigration on medium- and long-term political outcomes in Brazil. Using a unique dataset containing vote shares of presidential elections at the municipal level from 1955 to 2018, we find that municipalities with a higher inflow of immigrants in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century exhibited increased support for left-wing parties in the first democratic elections (1955-1960). We show that these political preferences persisted in the long run (1989-2018) when the country transitioned from a military dictatorship to a democracy. Our analysis highlights the role of immigrants' influence on the labor movement as a mechanism for transmitting values and preferences to the native population. We show that Brazilians living in municipalities with higher exposure to historical immigration are more likely to support democracy, exhibit higher levels of trust in institutions, and report preferences for redistribution.

**[Fiscal Capacity and the Provision of Public Goods in Brazil, 1891-1930][child_labor]** <br/>
<small> with [Marcos Nakaguma](https://sites.google.com/view/nakaguma/home) </small> <br/>
<small> <a href="#/" onclick="visib('fiscal_capacity')">Abstract</a> | [Draft][fiscal_capacity] </small>

<div id="fiscal_capacity" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2" ><small>
This paper examines the impact of agricultural booms on tax collection and public goods provision in Brazilian municipalities during the First Republic (1891-1930). We build a unique yearly panel dataset on public finance outcomes and employ a panel estimation approach that leverages exogenous variation in land suitability to estimate the impacts of coffee price fluctuations on the development of fiscal institutions in São Paulo. Our results reveal a strong positive relationship between coffee price booms and local tax collection between 1898 and 1928. Revenue increases primarily originated from indirect taxes on goods, services, and wealth transfers, imposing a disproportionate burden on the poorest individuals. We also document that exposure to coffee booms was associated with higher investments in public goods and services. These findings contribute to our understanding of how agricultural booms, coupled with the fiscal federalism structure of the 1891 constitution, influenced the capacity of Brazilian municipalities to establish tax systems that generate revenue from diverse sources.

**Sugarcane Expansion and Development: Evidence from São Paulo** <br/>
<small> With Yuri Luz and [Marcos Nakaguma](https://sites.google.com/view/nakaguma/home) </small> <br/>
<small> <a href="#/" onclick="visib('sugarcane')">Abstract</a> | Draft (coming soon) </small>

<div id="sugarcane" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2" ><small>
This paper studies the impacts of sugarcane expansion on socioeconomic indicators in the Brazilian state of São Paulo, where the harvested area doubled in ten years. Using data from São Paulo municipalities and exploiting soil- and climate-induced variation in agricultural production patterns, we find that localities where sugarcane expanded experienced restructuring of the local agriculture sector from pasture lands to temporary crops. We also document a structural transformation in economic activity towards manufacturing and a faster increase in income per capita.
